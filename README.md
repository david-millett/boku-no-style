# boku-no-style


day 1
Started work on the project
First step is to create a functioning website
created a server and landing page
next created a brands controller to define the brands routes
created a navbar
created the two main models I need - user model and brand model
no huge stumbling blocks - there are some parts I will come back to later after setting up basic functionality, like adding pictures to the brands model


day 2
sorted CRUD for the brands
made sign up and sign in forms


day 3
no huge issues to begin with - problem solving of errors was just minor syntax mistakes with sign in form
